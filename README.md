Auto Glossary is an Obsidian plugin to generate a [glossary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary) or a [MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/MOCs+Overview) (or a combination of both) from a selected folder.

## How to install
You can install this plugin directly within Obsidian or you can copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/auto-glossary/`.

## Usage
You can create the file you want by right-clicking on a folder in Obsidian.

## ⚠️ Contribute
I stopped working on this project. Feel free to contribute to the code of this plugin, since there are more features to be implemented (and it needs a nice refactoring too). You can also share feedback, issues, and ideas.
